## Some Wisdom At The End
Last but not least an inspiring quote by James Clear that helps me staying focused and letting go all kinds of pressure.
> Most things are not as difficult as they seem—if you focus each day. However, giving one topic your full attention for an extended period of time is even harder than it seems. Over a long timeline, the bottleneck is usually attention not ability."
