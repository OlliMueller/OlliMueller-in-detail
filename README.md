#### Some Wisdom At The End
Last but not least an inspiring quote by James Clear that helps me staying focused and letting go all kinds of pressure.
> Most things are not as difficult as they seemâ€”if you focus each day. However, giving one topic your full attention for an extended period of time is even harder than it seems. Over a long timeline, the bottleneck is usually attention not ability."
